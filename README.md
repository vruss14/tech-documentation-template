# Technical Documentation Template

## Overview
A template for technical documentation pages.

## Description

This is a simple page built with HTML and CSS that can be used as a template for creating technical documentation pages. It includes a sidebar of contents on the left, and the main content on the right. In the future, I plan on including more advanced functionality such as a slight color change depending on which section of content is currently displayed on the page.
